# Testing

 

## Manual Testing

When testing features that involve brand creation, follow these conventions:

- Create test brands with the `testpb-` prefix in the slug (e.g., `testpb-my-test-brand`)
- This prefix helps identify test data and can be used to filter or clean up test brands if needed

## Test Data Isolation

To ensure test data doesn't impact customer brands:

- Never modify or delete customer brands during testing
- Always use the `testpb-` prefix for any test brands, users, or data
- When testing features that interact with existing data, create new test brands instead of using customer brands
